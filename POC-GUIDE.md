# TrendAI Vision One File Security on AWS — POC Guide

**Service Gateway virtual appliances · S3 malware-scanning pipeline**

Everything needed to evaluate Vision One File Security on Service Gateway virtual appliances: create the accounts, deploy the pipeline, prove it detects malware, connect your own application in Java, and tear it all down cleanly. Two CloudFormation stacks and one console click get you a running scanner.

# Part I — Deploy

## 1. What you're evaluating

Files landing in an S3 bucket get scanned for malware automatically. Clean files are tagged and stay put; malicious files are tagged, copied to a quarantine bucket, and removed from the scan bucket. The pipeline is event-driven — verdicts typically land within seconds.

    style C fill:#F1FAFF,stroke:#0073BB,stroke-width:2px
```

Scanning is done by TrendAI **Service Gateway virtual appliances** — stock AWS Marketplace AMIs running the File Security scanner. Your files are scanned **inside your VPC**; only scan metadata goes to TrendAI. The appliances are reached over gRPC/TLS on port 443, their documented scanner interface.

You deploy two independent stacks:

| Stack | Creates | Think of it as |
|---|---|---|
| `scanner.yaml` | VPC, 1–8 appliances, provisioner Lambda ("the watchdog"), secrets, VPC endpoints | The scanning *service* — reusable by any application |
| `worker.yaml` | Scan + quarantine buckets, SQS queue + DLQ, worker fleet, CloudWatch dashboard | A complete reference *application* driving the service |

### The architecture in one picture

![AWS architecture diagram](assets/architecture.svg)

### Complete resource inventory

| Stack | Group | Resources |
|---|---|---|
| `scanner.yaml` | Networking | VPC (10.2.0.0/16) · Internet Gateway · 2 public subnets · 2 NAT Gateways + EIPs · up to 8 private subnets (one per appliance) · route tables · VPC Flow Logs (all traffic, 30-day retention). All skipped in existing-VPC mode. |
| `scanner.yaml` | VPC endpoints | S3 (gateway) + 8 interface endpoints: SSM, SSMMessages, EC2Messages, Secrets Manager, SQS, CloudWatch Logs, STS, EC2 — with their security group |
| `scanner.yaml` | Appliances | 1–8 Service Gateway EC2 instances (c5.2xlarge default; stock Marketplace AMI; IMDSv2, encrypted EBS, termination protection) · launch template · security group (80/443/22 from the VPC CIDR, egress 443 only) · IAM role + instance profile (`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`) |
| `scanner.yaml` | Provisioner | Watchdog Lambda (Python 3.12, 256 MB, X-Ray) · IAM role (reads the launch key + appliance-v1fs secrets/params, tags its own instances) · in private subnets to SSH the appliances · paramiko layer · EventBridge schedule rate(15 min) |
| `scanner.yaml` | Build | CodeBuild project (packages the watchdog from GitHub) · deploy bucket · one-shot trigger Lambda |
| `scanner.yaml` | Secrets | `appliance-v1fs/vision-one-api-key` · `…/sg-registration-token` (from parameters) · `…/sg-ca-cert` (created by the watchdog). Retained on stack deletion. |
| `worker.yaml` | S3 | Scan bucket (event notifications → SQS) · quarantine bucket — both AES256, HTTPS-only policies, all public access blocked |
| `worker.yaml` | Queue | SQS scan queue (SSE, long-polling) + dead-letter queue (after 5 receives) |
| `worker.yaml` | Workers | Auto Scaling group (t3.medium ×2–10) + launch template (IMDSv2, encrypted EBS) · SQS-depth step scaling · IAM role (S3 + SQS + Secrets read + audit logs + EC2 discovery) |
| `worker.yaml` | Observability | CloudWatch dashboard · alarms + SNS topic (KMS-encrypted) · `scan-audit-<stack>` log group |

Worth validating as you go: hands-free appliance provisioning ([§5](#5-meet-the-watchdog)), appliance access over SSH via the documented root path, VPC-internal only ([§12](#12-how-the-provisioner-reaches-the-appliance)), appliances running essentially stock TrendAI software ([§13](#13-drift-from-the-default-deployment)), and linear scaling — add appliances, get throughput ([§14](#14-performance-expectations)).

## 2. Vision One setup

Three things come out of this section: an account, an **API key**, and — timed right — a **registration token**.

### Create the account

Sign up for TrendAI Vision One (trial or licensed) with a business email. **Choose your data region carefully** — it determines where scan metadata is processed and cannot be changed later. Verify your email and sign in.

### Enable File Security

Console → *Cloud Security → File Security* → on first visit, click **Continue with Virtual Appliance**. Nothing else to configure here yet.

### Create the API key

The API key authenticates every scan request, and it needs one specific permission. Click by click:

1. Sign in to the Vision One console.
2. In the left navigation, go to **Administration → User Roles**. Confirm a role exists with the **"Run file scan via SDK"** permission enabled. If none does, click **Add Role**, tick that permission, give the role a name, and click **Save**.
3. In the left navigation, go to **Administration → API Keys**, then click **Add API Key**.
4. In the dialog: enter a **Name** (e.g. `fs-scanner-eval`), select the **Role** from step 2, and set an **Expiry** (30–90 days for an evaluation).
5. Click **Add**. The key value appears **once** — click **Copy** and paste it somewhere safe for now. You'll hand it to CloudFormation in [§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack), which stores it in Secrets Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't get the registration token yet** — it expires 24 hours after you generate it. You'll grab it as the first click-by-click step of [§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack), immediately before deploying.

## 3. AWS setup

| You need | Details |
|---|---|
| **Credentials** | A role that can create VPCs, EC2, IAM roles, Lambda, S3, SQS. Verify: `aws sts get-caller-identity` |
| **A region** | Pick one and stay in it. Defaults assume us-east-1 AZs — override `PrimaryAZ`/`SecondaryAZ` elsewhere. |
| **Staging bucket** | The templates exceed CloudFormation's inline limit: `aws s3 mb s3://<staging-bucket>` |

### Subscribe to the appliance AMI (required, one-time, free)

The Service Gateway image is an AWS Marketplace product. Your account **must accept its terms before deploying** — otherwise the stack fails when it tries to launch an appliance, with `401 / AccessDenied` on the EC2 instance. Click by click:

1. Open the product page: **https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=a4akc5rzzt5b2a9trld1chlf**
2. Click **Continue to Subscribe**.
3. Click **Accept Terms**, then wait until the subscription shows active (usually under a minute).

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, in the AWS Marketplace console search for **"TrendAI Service Gateway BYOL"** and subscribe there. You only do this once per AWS account.

## 4. Deploy the scanner stack

> [!NOTE]
> **Evaluation sizing:** 2 appliances (c5.2xlarge) — enough to demonstrate load balancing with ~29M files/day of capacity, at roughly $17/day of EC2 cost. Scale to 8 later with a single stack update.

### Step 4a — Get the template

Download **`scanner.yaml`** from the repository — ideally from a tagged release if one is published, so it matches the provisioner code the stack pulls at deploy time. (The scanner stack's CodeBuild pulls the provisioner from the repo's `main` branch during creation, so a template from that same state stays consistent.) That one file is all you need — you do **not** have to clone the repo.

### Step 4b — Get the registration token (console, click by click)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The token expires **24 hours** after you generate it, so do this right before the deploy in Step 4c — not earlier.

1. Sign in to the Vision One console.
2. In the left navigation, go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.
3. Click **Download Virtual Appliance** (top-right of the page). A dialog opens.
4. In the dialog, find **Registration Token** and click **Copy**. Paste it somewhere safe for the next step.
5. Close the dialog. **You are not downloading anything** — our appliance AMI comes from AWS Marketplace, so ignore the image-type and download-disk options; the dialog is only where the token lives.

### Step 4c — Create the stack (console upload)

The simplest path uploads the template directly in the Create-stack wizard — no S3 bucket to create; the console stages it for you.

1. Open the **CloudFormation console → Create stack → With new resources (standard)**.
2. Under **Specify template**, choose **Upload a template file → Choose file →** select `scanner.yaml` **→ Next**.
3. **Stack name:** `scanner-1`. Then fill the parameters: paste **VisionOneApiKey** (from [§2](#2-vision-one-setup)) and **SGRegistrationToken** (from Step 4b), set **ServiceGatewayCount** (e.g. `2`), and leave the rest at their defaults. **Next**.
4. Under **Stack failure options**, choose **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** — the console equivalent of `--disable-rollback`, so a failure leaves resources up for inspection. **Next**.
5. On the review page, tick **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**, then **Submit**.

> [!TIP]
> **Prefer the CLI?** Upload the template to any S3 bucket and create the stack from its URL. The template exceeds CloudFormation's 51 KB inline limit, so an S3 URL is required (you can't pass it inline with `--template-body`):
> ```bash
> aws s3 cp scanner.yaml s3://<staging-bucket>/scanner.yaml
> aws cloudformation create-stack \
>   --stack-name scanner-1 \
>   --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/<staging-bucket>/scanner.yaml \
>   --parameters \
>     ParameterKey=ServiceGatewayCount,ParameterValue=2 \
>     ParameterKey=VisionOneApiKey,ParameterValue="<api-key>" \
>     ParameterKey=SGRegistrationToken,ParameterValue="<registration-token>" \
>   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
>   --disable-rollback
> ```

**This stack does not report `CREATE_COMPLETE` the moment its resources exist.** Two built-in gates hold it open until the fleet is genuinely scan-ready, so completion is a signal you can trust — no tag-polling:

| Gate (a resource in the stack) | The stack pauses here while… |
|---|---|
| **`WaitForRegistration`** | the watchdog registers every appliance with Vision One (automated, a few minutes) |
| **`WaitForFileSecurity`** | it waits for **you** to install File Security ([§6](#6-install-file-security)) and for each appliance to finish provisioning |

Watch these in the CloudFormation **Resources** (or **Events**) tab. The moment **`WaitForRegistration`** turns `CREATE_COMPLETE` and **`WaitForFileSecurity`** goes `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` is your cue to do [§6](#6-install-file-security). When the whole stack reaches **`CREATE_COMPLETE`**, every appliance is registered, File-Security-installed, and scan-ready — your all-clear to deploy the worker stack ([§7](#7-deploy-the-worker-stack)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Redeploying later? Three rules.** Always use a fresh, incrementing stack name (`scanner-2`, `scanner-3`…); always generate a fresh registration token; and delete leftover `appliance-v1fs/*` secrets first — they're retained on stack deletion, and a new stack fails with *AlreadyExists* if they linger (command in [§17](#17-teardown)).

## 5. Meet the watchdog

The **watchdog** is a small Lambda (`provisioner-<stack>`) that runs every 15 minutes and owns the entire appliance lifecycle. It's the reason this deployment needs no manual appliance setup: no console sessions, no copy-pasting into terminals. If an appliance exists, the watchdog finds it, registers it, configures it, and keeps it configured. (During deployment, the `WaitForRegistration` and `WaitForFileSecurity` gates from [§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack) invoke this same watchdog on a tight loop, so the stack progresses without waiting on the 15-minute schedule.)

On every pass, for every appliance (found by EC2 tag), it walks this state machine:

| Appliance state | What the watchdog does |
|---|---|
| **Not registered** | Sets the hostname (FSVA-AWS-01…) so it's identifiable in Vision One, then runs the appliance's own `register <token>` CLI command with the token from Secrets Manager — retrying, since fresh appliances need 1–3 minutes before accepting commands. Tags `registered=true`. |
| **Registered, no scanner yet** | Waits. File Security must be installed from the console ([§6](#6-install-file-security)) — the watchdog checks each pass for the scanner to appear. |
| **Scanner running, not provisioned** | Finishes the job: disables weak TLS ciphers (documented CLI command), extracts the appliance's TLS certificate into Secrets Manager, raises the upload size limit if the file-size parameter requires it, records the scanner version, tags `provisioned=true`. |
| **Fully provisioned** (steady state) | Health-checks each pass: re-applies the upload limit only if a scanner update reverted it, keeps the scan-cache setting consistent with the stack parameter, and re-extracts the certificate if the scanner version changed (in case it rotated). |

```bash
# Watch the watchdog work
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/provisioner-scanner-1 --follow

# Impatient? Trigger a pass now instead of waiting up to 15 minutes
aws lambda invoke --function-name provisioner-scanner-1 \
  --payload '{"action":"watchdog"}' /dev/stdout
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a watchdog instead of one-time provisioning?** Appliance updates arrive from Vision One on TrendAI's schedule, and an update can revert local configuration or rotate the TLS certificate. A one-shot provisioner would silently drift; a 15-minute reconciliation loop self-heals. It also makes scaling trivial — raise `ServiceGatewayCount` and new appliances are registered and provisioned automatically.

### What it automates for you

Without the watchdog you would SSH into each appliance and run every one of these by hand — then repeat on every appliance and re-check after each scanner update. The watchdog runs them all for you over SSH, using TrendAI's documented root path ([§12](#12-how-the-provisioner-reaches-the-appliance)): as `admin` (the launch key pair) for the clish steps, and as `sgowner` (root) for the shell steps.

| Manual step it replaces | What the watchdog runs | As | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Set the appliance's OS hostname | `hostnamectl set-hostname FSVA-AWS-NN` | sgowner | Gives the appliance a stable, identifiable name |
| Name the endpoint in the CLI | `configure endpoint FSVA-AWS-NN` | admin clish | Sets the Vision One endpoint name to match the hostname |
| Register the appliance | `register <token>` (retried up to 3×) | admin clish | Registers the SG with Vision One using the token from Secrets Manager |
| Confirm registration succeeded | `show version` (checks `Status: Registered`) | admin clish | Gates the next steps until the appliance is actually registered |
| Harden TLS ciphers | `configure nginx-ingress-controller-cipher disable-weak` | admin clish | Disables weak/legacy TLS ciphers on ports 80/443 |
| Wait for the scanner to come up | `configure verify plat` (checks for `sg-sfs-scanner … Running`) | admin clish | Detects when File Security's scanner pod is running |
| Raise the upload size limit | `sudo microk8s kubectl -n ingress patch configmap nginx-load-balancer-microk8s-conf … proxy-body-size=<MaxFileSizeMB>m` *(only when the live value differs)* | sgowner | Lets gRPC scan files larger than the 10 MB default |
| Apply the scan-cache setting | `sudo microk8s kubectl set env deployment --all -n sg-sfs-scanner TM_AM_SCAN_CACHE=false` *(only when `ScanCacheEnabled=false`; otherwise the override is removed)* | sgowner | Honors your parameter; leaves the appliance default untouched otherwise |
| Extract the TLS CA certificate | `openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -servername sg.sgi.xdr.trendmicro.com </dev/null \| openssl x509` → Secrets Manager (`appliance-v1fs/sg-ca-cert`) | sgowner | Captures the appliance's self-signed cert so SDK clients can trust it ([§10](#10-scan-from-your-own-code-java)) |
| Track the scanner version | `sudo microk8s kubectl get pod -n sg-sfs-scanner -o jsonpath='…image'` → SSM Parameter Store | sgowner | Notices TrendAI scanner updates so it can re-extract the cert if it rotates |
| Record lifecycle state | `aws ec2 create-tags … appliance-v1fs:registered=true` / `…:provisioned=true` | AWS API | Marks progress; the workers and the deploy gates ([§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack)) read these tags |

Everything above is idempotent and re-checked every 15 minutes, so a scanner update that reverts the upload limit or rotates the certificate is corrected on the next pass without you touching the appliance.

## 6. Install File Security

This is the **one manual step** in the whole deployment: TrendAI requires the File Security service to be installed onto each appliance from the Vision One console, and provides no API for it.

**You're here because the scanner stack told you so.** It has finished `WaitForRegistration` and is now paused at **`WaitForFileSecurity`** ([§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack)) — that pause *is* the "install now" signal, and it means the appliance is already registered. No tag-checking required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Wait for any firmware upgrade to finish first.** A freshly launched appliance often self-upgrades to the newest Service Gateway firmware on first boot — this update is delivered over-the-air by Vision One and is **independent of the AMI version**, so it happens even on the latest AMI. If the appliance's page shows *"An update is in progress (Version: 3.0.x…)"*, **wait for it to clear** (usually ~10–20 minutes) before installing File Security; the install won't proceed mid-upgrade.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `WaitForFileSecurity` gate times out after **90 minutes** — enough to absorb a firmware upgrade plus the install. If it lapses, the stack fails at `WaitForFileSecurity` (nothing is lost; you finish the install, then redeploy).

**Click by click in the Vision One console:**

1. Sign in to the Vision One console.
2. In the left navigation, go to **Workflow and Automation → Service Gateway Management**.
3. The inventory lists your appliances by hostname — **FSVA-AWS-01**, **FSVA-AWS-02**, and so on. Click the **name** of the first appliance.
4. On the appliance details page, click **Manage Services**. A drawer opens listing the services you can install.
5. Find **File Security Virtual Appliance** in the list and click its **install** icon (the download-arrow icon next to the name). A resource check runs first, then installation begins.
6. Wait until the **Status** column for File Security reads **Healthy** — usually a few minutes.
7. **Repeat steps 3–6 for each remaining appliance** (FSVA-AWS-02, …). A single-appliance evaluation is done after the first.

> [!NOTE]
> **No mount points to configure.** This pipeline scans by sending file bytes over gRPC (the SDK), not by mounting NFS/SMB shares — so once File Security shows **Healthy**, ignore the gear/configure icon and the "Add mount point" flow. Those are only for the appliance's file-share scanning mode, which we don't use.

**That's the last thing you click — the stack takes it from here.** The `WaitForFileSecurity` gate is driving the watchdog for you; as soon as File Security is **Healthy** on every appliance, it finishes provisioning (cert extraction, nginx patch, cipher hardening), releases the gate, and the **scanner stack reaches `CREATE_COMPLETE`**. That completion is your all-clear for [§7](#7-deploy-the-worker-stack) — no tag-watching needed.

Timeline check: from `create-stack` to `CREATE_COMPLETE` is typically **30–45 minutes**, most of it the automated registration/provisioning around your single console visit.

## 7. Deploy the worker stack

```bash
aws s3 cp worker.yaml s3://<staging-bucket>/worker.yaml

aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name worker-1 \
  --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/<staging-bucket>/worker.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=ScannerStackName,ParameterValue=scanner-1 \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --disable-rollback

# Bucket names and queue URL are in the outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name worker-1 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' --output table
```

Defaults are right for an evaluation: 2–10 t3.medium workers auto-scaling on queue depth, TLS on (the documented appliance endpoint), Predictive Machine Learning on, 500 MB max file size. Workers discover the appliances by EC2 tag — no endpoints to configure.

---

# Part II — Verify & Integrate

## 8. Prove it works

### A clean file, tagged in place

```bash
echo "hello scanner" | aws s3 cp - s3://<scan-bucket>/hello.txt
sleep 5
aws s3api get-object-tagging --bucket <scan-bucket> --key hello.txt
```

### Malware, quarantined

**EICAR** is the industry-standard test file: a harmless 68-byte string every antivirus deliberately detects. Pipe it straight to S3 — writing it to disk would set off your laptop's own antivirus:

```bash
printf 'X5O!P%%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*' \
  | aws s3 cp - s3://<scan-bucket>/eicar-test.txt
```

Within seconds:

| File | Outcome | Tagged |
|---|---|---|
| `hello.txt` | Stays in the scan bucket | **Clean** + ScanTimestamp |
| `eicar-test.txt` | Gone from the scan bucket; lands in quarantine at `<scan-bucket>/eicar-test.txt` | **Malware** |

And the audit log has the receipt:

```bash
aws logs tail scan-audit-worker-1 --since 5m
# → {"file":"eicar-test.txt","verdict":"malicious","malware":["Eicar_test_file"],
#    "scanDurationMs":38,"serviceGateway":"FSVA-AWS-01",...}
```

### A burst, on the dashboard

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 500); do
  echo "test file $i" | aws s3 cp - s3://<scan-bucket>/load/file-$i.txt &
done; wait
```

Open the stack's CloudWatch dashboard and watch queue depth spike and drain, scans/sec rise, and — the interesting one — per-appliance scan counts staying near 50/50.

> [!WARNING]
> **Testing with real malware?** Keep samples in S3 and move them with server-side copy only (`aws s3 cp s3://samples/… s3://<scan-bucket>/…`). Samples must never touch a workstation.

| ☐ | (If in scope) throughput target met — [§14](#14-performance-expectations) for per-appliance expectations | Your load test |

## 10. Scan from your own code (Java)

The worker fleet is just a reference application — the real goal is your applications scanning directly. This section shows **Java**; the Python, Go, and Node.js SDKs follow the same pattern. Basic Java knowledge is enough — gRPC and File Security concepts are explained as we go. Facts verified against `file-security-java-sdk` 1.6.3.

### The picture

The scanner answers one question — *"is this file malicious?"* You send bytes, it returns a small JSON verdict. Transport is **gRPC** (remote procedure calls over HTTP/2), but you never write gRPC code — the SDK wraps it in one class:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Your Java app<br/><small>AMaasClient</small>"] -- "gRPC/TLS :443" --> B["Appliance<br/><small>private IP, port 443</small>"]
    B --> C["JSON verdict<br/><small>scanResult 0 = clean</small>"]
    style B fill:#F1FAFF,stroke:#0073BB,stroke-width:2px
```

### Add the SDK

The SDK is on Maven Central and needs Java 8 or newer.

**pom.xml**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.trend</groupId>
  <artifactId>file-security-java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**build.gradle**

```groovy
implementation 'com.trend:file-security-java-sdk:1.6.3'
```

### The constructor, annotated

One constructor does everything. For a Service Gateway appliance you pass its address as `host`; the region argument is ignored when a host is given:

```java
public AMaasClient(String region,      // "" — only used for Trend's cloud service
                   String host,        // the appliance, e.g. "10.2.3.45:443"
                   String apiKey,      // Vision One key with "Run file scan via SDK"
                   long   timeoutInSecs,  // per-scan deadline; 0 = default 180
                   boolean enabledTLS,    // true — 443 is the appliance's TLS endpoint
                   String caCertPath)  // PEM to trust, or null (see "TLS" below)
    throws AMaasException
```

### Connect once, scan many

**FirstScan.java**

```java
import com.trend.cloudone.amaas.AMaasClient;
import com.trend.cloudone.amaas.AMaasException;

public class FirstScan {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String apiKey = System.getenv("V1FS_API_KEY");   // same key the stack uses
        try {
            // 1. Connect ONCE. Appliance address = its private IP, port 443.
            AMaasClient client = new AMaasClient(
                    "", "10.2.3.45:443", apiKey, 300, true, null);
            try {
                // 2. Scan (blocks until the verdict; default limit 3 minutes)
                String resultJson = client.scanFile("/tmp/suspicious.pdf");
                System.out.println(resultJson);            // 3. the JSON verdict
            } finally {
                client.close();                            // 4. once, at shutdown
            }
        } catch (AMaasException e) {
            System.err.println("Scan failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Constructing the client is the expensive part — it builds the gRPC *channel* (a managed HTTP/2 connection: one TCP + TLS handshake, like a phone line that stays open). Each scan then opens a cheap *stream* on that line. Your API key rides along automatically on every call.

### Reuse the connection — the one rule that matters

**Create one `AMaasClient` per appliance and keep it for the life of your application.** It is thread-safe; all your threads share it, and gRPC multiplexes their scans over the single connection.

```java
// GOOD — one client, shared by the whole app
public final class Scanner {
    private static final AMaasClient CLIENT = create();

    private static AMaasClient create() {
        try {
            return new AMaasClient("", System.getenv("SG_ADDR"),   // e.g. 10.2.3.45:443
                    System.getenv("V1FS_API_KEY"), 300, true, null);
        } catch (AMaasException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot reach the file scanner", e);
        }
    }
    public static String scan(byte[] b, String label) throws AMaasException {
        return CLIENT.scanBuffer(b, label);                // safe from any thread
    }
    public static void shutdown() { CLIENT.close(); }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Anti-pattern:** `new AMaasClient(...)` inside a request handler or loop. Every construction pays the full connection setup and leaks channels unless each is closed. One-scan-per-client code should be refactored.

> [!TIP]
> **How parallel can you go?** Each appliance runs up to **32 scans at once**; a pool of ~16–48 threads per appliance keeps it busy. Multiple appliances? One client each, round-robin. Discover them like the workers do: running EC2 instances tagged `appliance-v1fs:stack=scanner-1` — private IP, port 443.

When your application shuts down, close the client once to release the channel:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> Scanner.shutdown()));
```

### Submit scans

Two methods cover nearly everything; both return the verdict as a JSON `String`. The `digest` flag matters more than it looks: it hashes the file so repeat scans of identical content hit the appliance's scan cache and return near-instantly — keep it `true`.

```java
// A file on disk
String json = client.scanFile(
    "/data/uploads/invoice.pdf",   // path
    true,                           // digest: hash so repeat scans hit the cache
    options);

// Bytes already in memory (an upload, a queue message, an S3 object)
byte[] payload = ...;
String json = client.scanBuffer(
    payload,
    "invoice.pdf",                  // identifier — shows up as fileName in the result
    true,
    options);
```

Options are built once and reused across calls:

```java
AMaasScanOptions options = AMaasScanOptions.builder()
    .pml(true)                     // predictive machine learning
    .activeContent(true)           // also flag PDF scripts and Office macros
    .verbose(false)                // true = much bigger, engine-level response
    .tagList(new String[]{"my-app"})  // up to 8 tags, visible in the console
    .build();
```

### TLS to the appliance

The appliance serves a self-signed certificate (for `*.sgi.xdr.trendmicro.com`). Two ways to deal with it:

| Approach | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Verify it** | Fetch the CA cert the watchdog stored in Secrets Manager (`appliance-v1fs/sg-ca-cert`), write it to a PEM file, pass its path as the constructor's last argument. Strict verification also checks the hostname, so this path needs a DNS name matching the certificate. | Across networks you don't fully control |
| **Trust it** | `export TM_AM_DISABLE_CERT_VERIFY=1` before starting the JVM — an official SDK switch. The connection stays encrypted; the server certificate just isn't authenticated. `caCertPath` may be null. | By-IP connections inside a private VPC you control |

> [!WARNING]
> This switch exists in the **Java** SDK only — the Python SDK has no equivalent (verified by test).

### Read the response

```jsonc
// Clean:
{ "scanId":"b1e3…", "scanResult":0, "scanTimestamp":"2026-07-13T18:04:11Z",
  "fileName":"quarterly-report.xlsx", "foundMalwares":[] }

// Malicious (EICAR):
{ "scanId":"2507…", "scanResult":1, "scanTimestamp":"2026-07-13T18:05:42Z",
  "fileName":"EICAR_TEST_FILE-1.exe",
  "foundMalwares":[ { "fileName":"Eicar.exe", "malwareName":"Eicar_test_file" } ] }
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scanResult` | **The verdict:** `0` Clean · `1+` Malware (the count of detections). The first field to check — but see `foundErrors` below. |
| `foundMalwares` | One entry per detection — `malwareName` plus the `fileName` it was in (can be a file *inside* an archive) |
| `scanId` / `scanTimestamp` | Correlate with the Vision One console; log them |

### The subtle third case: clean, but not fully inspected

The scan engine enforces decompression limits to defend against zip bombs (archive nesting depth, file counts, expansion ratio and size — console-configurable, see [§15](#15-day-to-day-operation)). When an archive *exceeds* a limit, the scanner returns `scanResult: 0` — but includes a `foundErrors` array telling you it couldn't look inside everything:

```jsonc
{
  "scanResult": 0,                    // says clean…
  "fileName": "deep-archive.zip",
  "foundMalwares": [],
  "foundErrors": [
    { "name": "ATSE_MAXDECOM_ERR" }   // …but a nesting limit was hit
  ]
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Treat `scanResult 0` *plus a non-empty* `foundErrors` as "not fully scanned", never as clean.

| foundErrors name | Limit that was exceeded |
|---|---|
| `ATSE_MAXDECOM_ERR` | Archive nesting depth (zip inside zip inside zip…) — appliance default 20 layers |
| `ATSE_ZIP_FILE_COUNT_ERR` | Number of files inside one archive (unlimited by default; may be tightened in the console) |
| `ATSE_ZIP_RATIO_ERR` | Compression ratio — the classic zip-bomb signal (unlimited by default) |
| `ATSE_EXTRACT_TOO_BIG_ERR` | Decompressed size — appliance default 2048 MB per file |

### Parsing it — three ways out, not two

The SDK's `AMaasScanResult` bean doesn't carry `foundErrors`, so check it on the raw JSON:

```java
JsonObject r = JsonParser.parseString(resultJson).getAsJsonObject();

boolean hasMalware   = r.get("scanResult").getAsInt() > 0;
boolean fullyScanned = !r.has("foundErrors")
                     || r.getAsJsonArray("foundErrors").isEmpty();

if (hasMalware) {
    for (JsonElement m : r.getAsJsonArray("foundMalwares")) {
        log.warn("Detected {} in {}",
            m.getAsJsonObject().get("malwareName").getAsString(),
            m.getAsJsonObject().get("fileName").getAsString());
    }
    quarantine(file);
} else if (!fullyScanned) {
    review(file);     // clean verdict, but limits were hit — don't trust it blindly
} else {
    accept(file);
}
```

### When things go wrong

A detection is *not* an error — malicious files come back as normal responses. Exceptions (`AMaasException`) mean the scan couldn't complete:

| Message contains | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "Authorization key cannot be authenticated" | Bad/expired key or missing role permission | Fix the key; don't retry |
| "gRPC status code: 14" (UNAVAILABLE) | Can't reach the scanner | Retry with backoff; check port 443 reachability |
| "gRPC status code: 4" (DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) | Timeout — default 3 minutes | Retry; raise `timeoutInSecs` for huge archives |
| "gRPC status code: 8" (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED) | Scanner saturated or file too large | Backoff / lower concurrency |
| "Failed to load SSL certificate" | Bad `caCertPath` | Fix the PEM path |

A scan that throws is neither clean nor malicious — it's *unknown*. Retry only the three transient codes (14, 4, 8), with backoff, ~3 attempts; never treat an exception as a clean verdict.

### Complete working example

Connects once, scans a clean buffer and the EICAR test string, prints both verdicts, closes cleanly.

**ScanDemo.java**

```java
import com.trend.cloudone.amaas.AMaasClient;
import com.trend.cloudone.amaas.AMaasException;
import com.trend.cloudone.amaas.AMaasScanOptions;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class ScanDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws AMaasException {
        String sgAddr = System.getenv("SG_ADDR");      // appliance IP:443
        String apiKey = System.getenv("V1FS_API_KEY");

        // 1. Connect ONCE (by-IP: set TM_AM_DISABLE_CERT_VERIFY=1, see "TLS" above)
        AMaasClient client = new AMaasClient("", sgAddr, apiKey, 300, true, null);

        AMaasScanOptions options = AMaasScanOptions.builder()
            .tagList(new String[]{"scan-demo"})
            .build();

        try {
            // 2. A clean buffer
            byte[] clean = "hello, this is a harmless file".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
            System.out.println("clean → " + client.scanBuffer(clean, "clean.txt", true, options));

            // 3. The EICAR test string — split so this source file is never
            //    itself flagged by antivirus. Every engine detects the joined form.
            String eicar = "X5O!P%@AP[4\\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-"
                         + "ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*";
            byte[] mal = eicar.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
            System.out.println("eicar → " + client.scanBuffer(mal, "eicar.txt", true, options));
        } finally {
            // 4. Close ONCE, at shutdown
            client.close();
        }
    }
}
```

Expected output (trimmed):

```text
clean → {"scanResult": 0, "fileName": "clean.txt", "foundMalwares": [] …}
eicar → {"scanResult": 1, "fileName": "eicar.txt",
         "foundMalwares": [{"malwareName": "Eicar_test_file" …}] …}
```

# Part III — Under the Hood

## 11. Inside the scanner application

The worker fleet runs a single Python file — `app/scanner.py`, about 430 lines — and that's the entire application. It was kept deliberately small so an evaluator can read it in one sitting and adapt it with confidence.

### The whole thing in five steps

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Poll<br/><small>SQS long-poll ×10</small>"] --> B["Download<br/><small>S3 → memory</small>"]
    B --> C["Scan<br/><small>gRPC, round-robin</small>"]

    D --> E["Record<br/><small>JSON audit line</small>"]
    style C fill:#F1FAFF,stroke:#0073BB,stroke-width:2px
```

Everything else in the file is operational hygiene: a visibility-timeout heartbeat so slow scans aren't redelivered mid-flight, scan retries with backoff, appliance re-discovery every 60 seconds, and a SIGTERM handler that drains in-flight scans before exit so auto-scaling never kills work in progress.

### Built by elimination

Each design choice replaced something we tested and rejected — the simplicity is the result of removing machinery, not skipping it:

| Choice | What we tried first | Why the current design won |
|---|---|---|
| **Async, single event loop** (`amaas.grpc.aio` + aiobotocore) | Threads + the synchronous SDK | The sync path leaked OS threads under sustained load — 9,000+ observed. The async worker holds steady at ~a dozen threads for days. |
| **Direct-to-appliance, client-side round-robin**, discovery by EC2 tag | An ALB, then an NLB in front of the appliances | The ALB hit RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED and timeouts under load; the NLB coalesced connections onto one appliance. Direct was fastest *and* removed an infrastructure layer. Discovery is one EC2 API call. |
| **One reused gRPC handle per appliance** | Pools of channels, per-scan channels | HTTP/2 multiplexes concurrent scans over one connection; the appliance pins streams to one connection anyway. One handle is both optimal and the least code. |
| **Concurrency derived from capacity** — appliances × 32 handlers × 1.5, enforced by a semaphore | A hand-tuned fixed number | Fixed values under-used the fleet at one size and overloaded it at another. Deriving it means scaling the fleet retunes the workers automatically. |
| **Verdict routing as plain S3 calls** | — | Tag / copy / delete are three idempotent API calls; a redelivered message just repeats them safely. No state store needed. |

### Adapting it

The only business logic is the verdict-routing block inside `_process_file()` — roughly 30 lines covering three outcomes: clean (tag in place), malicious (tag, quarantine, delete), and *not fully scanned* (a decompression limit was hit — tagged `ScanResult=NotFullyScanned` and left in place, never marked Clean; the limit names land in the audit entry). To make the pipeline do something else on any of these, that block is the one place to edit. Discovery, TLS, concurrency, retries, and shutdown all keep working untouched. The module docstring at the top of `app/scanner.py` is the 20-line version of this section.

## 12. How the provisioner reaches the appliance

The provisioner reaches each appliance over **SSH, using TrendAI's documented root path** (KB-0014380). All of it stays inside the VPC — **there is no inbound SSH from the outside world**: appliances have no public IP, and port 22 on the appliance security group is scoped to the VPC CIDR. The provisioner (a Lambda in the private subnets) connects only from within the VPC.

### The two hats

| Role | How it authenticates | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **`admin`** (clish) | the EC2 **launch key pair** — CloudFormation stores its private key in SSM Parameter Store at `/ec2/keypair/<id>`, which the Lambda reads | `configure endpoint`, `register`, cipher hardening, `show version`, pod-status checks |
| **`sgowner`** (root) | a key the provisioner generates each run and authorizes through `admin` clish `configure verify cli support <pubkey>` | `hostnamectl`, `sudo microk8s kubectl` (nginx patch, scan-cache, version), `openssl` cert extraction |

### Why SSH, not the SSM agent

The earlier design drove these same commands through the SSM agent (`AWS-RunShellScript`). We moved off it because **the Service Gateway firmware self-upgrade removes/disables the pre-installed SSM agent** — after a fresh appliance self-upgrades to the newest firmware, SSM goes `ConnectionLost` and doesn't recover (a reboot doesn't fix it). That stranded post-install provisioning entirely. The SSH root path doesn't have this problem: the `sgowner` key is authorized through the appliance's **own supported clish mechanism**, so it's part of the appliance's managed config and survives the firmware config-sync that wipes the foreign agent.

An upside of the switch: provisioning now uses TrendAI's **documented** root procedure rather than an agent the appliance doesn't manage — so it's *less* drift from the supported deployment, not more (see [§13](#13-drift-from-the-default-deployment)).

### Keeping it safe

- **No internet exposure** — no public IP, port 22 scoped to the VPC CIDR, provisioner connects only from inside the VPC.
- **Scoped credentials** — the `admin` private key lives in SSM Parameter Store (KMS-encrypted, IAM-scoped); the `sgowner` key is generated per invocation, ed25519, and never stored.
- **Least privilege** — the provisioner's IAM role can read only `/ec2/keypair/*` and `appliance-v1fs/*`, tag only its own stack's instances, and reach the appliances only on port 22 within the VPC.

### Interactive access for a human

- **Service Gateway:** SSH to its private IP from inside the VPC (as `admin`, or `sgowner` via the documented key method). If SSH is ever unavailable too, the **EC2 Serial Console** is the out-of-band fallback (no network required).
- **Workers:** `aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>` — the worker fleet runs Amazon Linux with a working SSM agent, so Session Manager is the simplest shell there.

## 13. Drift from the default deployment

This project deliberately stays as close as possible to the deployment TrendAI documents and supports. The appliances are stock Marketplace AMIs; scanning uses the official SDK against the documented gRPC/TLS endpoint; registration uses the documented CLI command; File Security is installed the documented way (console); decompression scan policy is configured the documented way (console). Every remaining deviation is listed here — nothing else is modified.

| # | Deviation | Why | Posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Automated access via SSH** to `admin` clish and `sgowner` root, from a VPC-resident Lambda; hostname set with `hostnamectl` (docs cover the CLI `configure endpoint`, not the OS hostname) | Hands-free provisioning that survives the firmware self-upgrade (which removes the SSM agent) ([§12](#12-how-the-provisioner-reaches-the-appliance)) | Uses TrendAI's **documented** root path (KB-0014380); low drift. VPC-internal only, no inbound SSH from outside |
| 2 | **nginx upload-limit patch.** The appliance's ingress defaults to 10 MB request bodies, blocking gRPC scans of larger files; the watchdog raises it to `MaxFileSizeMB` — only when the live value differs | Without it, files >10 MB fail to scan, while the product supports far larger files | The one true modification of appliance internals. Self-heals if an update reverts it. Flagged for re-test on current builds — if TrendAI has raised the default, this disappears |
| 3 | **Scan-cache override — only when disabled.** The appliance default (cache on) is untouched; `ScanCacheEnabled=false` applies an env override for worst-case benchmarking | Honest baseline numbers during testing | No override in normal operation; uses an internal variable when engaged |
| 4 | **TLS certificate extraction.** The watchdog reads the certificate the appliance serves (`openssl s_client`) into Secrets Manager | Python SDK clients can only trust the appliance via an explicit CA file — there is no "accept the appliance cert" switch in Python (verified by test; Java has one) | Read-only — nothing on the appliance changes. The cert feeds the SDK's documented `ca_cert` input |
| 5 | **TLS hostname handling.** Workers connect by IP and present the certificate's own name via a gRPC override (SNI), instead of creating DNS records matching the cert's wildcard | Avoids replicating a trendmicro.com domain in private DNS | Client-side only; certificate verification stays strict against the extracted CA |
| 6 | **A plaintext fallback exists.** `EnableTLS=false` switches workers to gRPC h2c on port 80 — an undocumented interface | Troubleshooting aid | Never the default; don't use beyond debugging |

**Explicitly untouched** (all appliance defaults): scanner pod replica count, concurrency (`TM_AM_MAX_HANDLER`), container images (updated by TrendAI via Vision One), Redis, MicroK8s/networking, storage sizing. The watchdog enforces nothing that matches a default — it only corrects genuine deviations.

## 14. Performance expectations

Benchmarked on this exact architecture — 7,159 unique real-world malware samples, 103,506 scans, cache *disabled* (worst case):

| Metric | Measured (2× c5.2xlarge appliances) |
|---|---|
| Sustained throughput | **339 scans/s** (29.3M files/day) |
| Peak | 402 scans/s |
| Latency p50 / p90 / p99 | 47 ms / 1.6 s / 2.2 s |
| Appliance balance | 50.0% / 50.0% |
| Errors / DLQ | 0 / 0 |

Scaling is linear at ~170 scans/s per appliance: 1 ≈ 14.7M files/day · 4 ≈ 58.7M · 8 ≈ 117M. In production the scan cache stays on (appliance default), so repeated file hashes return near-instantly and real throughput runs higher than these floors. Bigger instances don't help — the scanner's concurrency is fixed per appliance. **Scale out, not up.**

---

# Part IV — Operate & Wrap Up

## 15. Day-to-day operation

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Steady state | Hands-off. The watchdog reconciles every 15 minutes; appliance updates arrive from Vision One automatically and configuration is re-verified afterward. |
| Scale the fleet | Change `ServiceGatewayCount` — see [Scaling the fleet](#scaling-the-fleet) below (up and down behave differently). |
| Tune scan policy | Archive depth/ratio/count/size limits: Vision One → *File Security → Virtual Appliance* — the documented console knobs. |
| Watch the pipeline | The CloudWatch dashboard · `scan-audit-<worker-stack>` (one JSON line per scan) · `/aws/lambda/provisioner-<scanner-stack>` (watchdog) · SSM Session Manager for a shell anywhere. |

### Scaling the fleet

You resize by updating the scanner stack's `ServiceGatewayCount` (1–8) — but scaling **up** and **down** are not symmetric, because appliances have termination protection on by design.

**Scale up (e.g. 2 → 4)** — fully handled by an update; the two gates from [§4](#4-deploy-the-scanner-stack) re-run:

1. Update the scanner stack with the higher `ServiceGatewayCount` (console **Update → Use current template**, or `update-stack`). *(Existing-VPC deployments must also supply the new `ExistingPrivateSubnetNId` parameters, one per added appliance — otherwise the new instances have no subnet.)*
2. CloudFormation creates the new appliances and re-runs both gates (their `ExpectedCount` changed). The update **pauses at `WaitForFileSecurity`** — the same cue as first deploy.
3. **Install File Security on each new appliance** ([§6](#6-install-file-security)). The watchdog registers and provisions them; when all appliances are ready the update reaches `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.
4. Workers notice the new appliances within 60 seconds and rebalance automatically — no worker-stack change needed.

**Scale down (e.g. 4 → 2)** — requires one manual step first, because CloudFormation **cannot terminate a protected instance**. If you just lower the count, the update fails trying to delete the surplus appliances.

1. Identify the surplus appliances — the highest-numbered ones (`FSVA-AWS-04`, `FSVA-AWS-03`, … down to the new count) — and disable termination protection on each:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id <id> --no-disable-api-termination
   ```
2. Update the scanner stack with the lower `ServiceGatewayCount`. CloudFormation removes those appliances; the gates see the (already-satisfied) lower `ExpectedCount` and pass.
3. In the Vision One console, **disconnect the removed appliances** (Service Gateway Management → trash icon) so stale entries don't linger. Workers drop them from rotation within 60 seconds.

## 16. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Appliances fail to launch (`401 / AccessDenied`) | Marketplace subscription not accepted | Subscribe ([§3](#3-aws-setup)), redeploy |
| Stack stuck / fails at `WaitForRegistration` | Registration token expired (24 h) or appliance still booting | Check the provisioner Lambda logs; use a fresh token + new stack name |
| Stack stuck / fails at `WaitForFileSecurity` | File Security not yet installed via console, appliance still self-upgrading firmware, or install exceeded the 90-min gate | Wait out any in-progress firmware upgrade, then complete [§6](#6-install-file-security); if the gate already timed out, redeploy and install within the window |
| Files sit untagged in the scan bucket | Appliances not provisioned, or workers can't discover them | Check both tags; dashboard queue depth; worker logs via SSM session |
| Small files scan, >10 MB files fail | Appliance upload limit reverted by an update | Self-heals within 15 min; or trigger the watchdog and check its log |
| SDK client: immediate UNAVAILABLE | No route/SG rule to port 443, or TLS trust problem | Verify reachability from your subnet; re-read [§10](#10-scan-from-your-own-code-java) |
| Messages in the DLQ | A file failed scanning 5 times | Inspect the message; check size vs `MaxFileSizeMB`; scan manually via SDK |
| New stack fails: secret *AlreadyExists* | Retained secrets from a previous stack | Delete them ([§17](#17-teardown) step 6), redeploy |

## 17. Teardown

In this order — steps 3 and 6 are the ones people miss:

```bash
# 1. Empty both buckets (CloudFormation can't delete non-empty buckets).
#    Batched deletes, parallel by prefix — never `aws s3 rm --recursive` at scale.
aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket <bucket> --query 'Contents[].Key' --output text \
 | tr '\t' '\n' | split -l 1000 - /tmp/keys.
for f in /tmp/keys.*; do
  aws s3api delete-objects --bucket <bucket> \
    --delete "$(printf '{"Objects":[%s]}' "$(sed 's/.*/{"Key":"&"}/' $f | paste -sd, -)")" &
done; wait

# 2. Delete the worker stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name worker-1

# 3. Disable termination protection on the appliances (enabled on purpose —
#    scanner stack deletion fails otherwise)
for id in $(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:appliance-v1fs:stack,Values=scanner-1" \
              "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" \
    --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text); do
  aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id $id --no-disable-api-termination
done

# 4. Delete the scanner stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name scanner-1

# 5. Vision One console: Service Gateway Management → disconnect (trash) each appliance

# 6. Delete the retained secrets — required before any future deployment
for s in vision-one-api-key sg-registration-token sg-ca-cert; do
  aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id appliance-v1fs/$s \
    --force-delete-without-recovery
done
```

## 18. Cost

| Configuration | Compute | Monthly | ~Daily |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evaluation (this guide) | 2× c5.2xlarge + 2–10 t3.medium workers | ≈ $740 | ≈ $25 |
| Production reference (24M+ files/day) | 6× c5.2xlarge + 8 workers | ≈ $1,732 | ≈ $58 |

EC2 only; VPC endpoints, NAT, S3/SQS/CloudWatch add modest usage-based charges. A two-week evaluation at the 2-appliance size lands around $350–400 all-in. Tear down promptly ([§17](#17-teardown)).
